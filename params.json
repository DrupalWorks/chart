{"name":"CKEditor Charts","tagline":"Chart plugin for CKEditor","body":"CKEditor Chart Plugin\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nThis is a proof-of-concept plugin that adds support for injecting charts into CKEditor.\r\nTo render charts, the [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/) library is used.\r\nThe plugin serves as an example of using external JavaScript libraries in CKEditor, using the [widgets feature](http://docs.ckeditor.com/#!/guide/widget_sdk_intro). It has lots of comments inside to help you understand how it was built.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n1. Put the plugin into the CKEditor \"plugins\" folder.\r\n2. Enable the plugin with `config.extraPlugins`\r\n3. Add the `Chart` button to the toolbar if it will not appear automatically.\r\n\r\nIn case of any problems with installation, there is a sample available: (`samples/chart.html`), which should work out of the box.\r\n\r\n## Rendering charts on a website\r\n\r\nChart created in CKEditor is represented as a simple `<div>` element with data attributes. This is by design, because such a simplified form allows you to re-edit the chart in the future. It ensures that your content will be future-proof, allowing you to to use different styling for charts embed on your website when you redesign it or to use the future major versions of Chart.js library with different API/features.\r\n\r\nTo convert `<div>` elements into charts, include `chart.min.js` and `widget2chart.js` on your website. See `samples/chart.html` for an example.\r\n\r\n## Screenshot\r\n\r\n![Charts in CKEditor](http://s10.postimg.org/efvmb3fmh/chartjs.png)\r\n\r\n## The future of this plugin\r\n\r\nFor now, this is a proof-of-concept plugin. However if you would like to leave any feedback, fill a future request, report a bug etc., feel free to do so.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nLicensed under the GPL, LGPL and MPL licenses, at your choice.\r\n\r\nFor full details about the license, please check the LICENSE.md file.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
